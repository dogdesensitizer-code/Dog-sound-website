    <h1>About Calm Dog Thunder</h1>
    <p>Calm Dog Thunder was created to help dogs and their owners work through thunderstorm anxiety using safe, controlled sound training.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Many dogs experience stress during thunderstorms, fireworks, or other loud events. Our goal is to provide an accessible, easy-to-use tool that allows pet owners to gradually desensitize their dogs to these sounds, improving quality of life for both pets and their humans.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose a training session length and intensity</li>
        <li>Play realistic thunder sounds with optional rain background</li>
        <li>Manually trigger thunder at chosen moments for interactive training</li>
        <li>Adjust settings over time to help your dog adapt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>We are a small, pet-focused project run by dog owners, trainers, and tech enthusiasts. Our goal is to combine love for animals with practical technology that makes a difference.</p>
