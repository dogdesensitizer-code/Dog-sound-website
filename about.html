  <h1>About Calm Dog Thunder</h1>
  <p><strong>Calm Dog Thunder</strong> was created to help dogs and their families reduce stress during thunderstorms, fireworks, and other loud events. Our site provides gentle, customizable soundscapes designed to help desensitize pets in a safe and supportive way.</p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>We aim to make life easier for pet owners by offering a simple, accessible tool to calm dogs with sound therapy. Our approach combines expert knowledge and real-world testing with a focus on animal well-being.</p>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>Calm Dog Thunder is a small independent project built by pet lovers who understand the challenges of noise anxiety. This is not a large corporation — just people who want to help other pet owners find a practical solution.</p>
